# Diwali_Sales_Analysis
This project analyzed Diwali sales data to understand customer behavior and purchasing trends during the festive season. After cleaning and preparing the dataset, exploratory analysis revealed that women, particularly those aged 26â€“35, were the most active buyers, contributing significantly to overall sales. The majority of high-value customers were married women from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, working in sectors like IT, Healthcare, and Aviation. The most popular product categories were Food, Clothing, and Electronics. These insights highlight a clear customer persona and can help businesses tailor their marketing, inventory, and promotional strategies to better target high-potential buyers during festive seasons.
